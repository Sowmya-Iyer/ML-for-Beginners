# ML for Beginners

### This folder consists of the notebooks and datasets and step by step process of ML model applications

1. [Linear Regression Single-variable](Linear%20Regression%20Single-variable/Linear%20Regression.ipynb) - Given the data of per-capita income of previous years build a machine learning model that can predict per-capita income for a given year
2. [Linear Regression Multi-Variate](Linear%20Regression%20Multi-Variate/Linear%20Regression%20Multi-variate.ipynb) - Predict the salary of an employee given his experience, test score and interview score
3. [Gradient Descent computation](Gradient%20descent/gradient\_descent.ipynb) - Comput and visualize Gradient descent
4. [Pickle and joblib](Save%20or%20Load%20a%20model/Save%20and%20load.ipynb) - Saving a trained model using pickle and joblib
5. [One Hot Encoding](One%20Hot%20Encoding/One%20Hot%20Encoding.ipynb) - Steps to encode a multi-class label using Dummies and One Hot Encoding
6. [Splitting Data using train\_test\_split](Splitting%20data/train\_test\_split%20function.ipynb) - Given a dataset containing prices of used BMW cars, analyze it and build a prediction function that can predict a price by taking the mileage and age of the car as input. We will use sklearn train\_test\_split method to split the training and testing dataset
7. [Logistic Regression](Logitic%20Regression/Logistic%20Regression.ipynb) - Given an HR analytics dataset consisting of satisfaction level, salary, etc. predict if the employee is likely to quit or not
8. [Logistic Regression - multi-class and Confusion matrix plotting](Logistic%20Regression%20and%20Confusion%20Matrix/Logistic%20regression.ipynb) - MNIST dataset classification using Logistic regression
9. [Decision Tree](Decision%20Tree/Decision%20Tree.ipynb) - Survival prediction on Titanic Dataset
10. [Random Forest](Random%20Forest/Random%20Forest.ipynb) - Given IOWA property sale data predict the sale price of a property
11. [Support Vector Machine](Support%20Vector%20Machine/SVM%20using%20mnist.ipynb) - Classify digits using pixel values from MNIST dataset using SVM
12. [K-fold Cross Validation](K-Fold/K-Fold.ipynb) - Perform k-fold validation on IRIS dataset using Random Forest Classifiers&#x20;
13. [K-means](K%20means/K-means.ipynb) - Perform k-means clustering on income dataset
14. [Naive Bayes](Naive%20Bayes/Naive%20Bayes%20-%20Spam%20detection.ipynb) - Spam detection using Naive Bayes
15. [GridsearchCV](GridSearchCV/Grid%20Search.ipynb) - Hypertune SVM model for IRIS dataset classification using GridSearch&#x20;
